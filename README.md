# mindsdb-sagemaker-container
This example shows how to package MindsDB for use with SageMaker.

SageMaker supports two execution modes: training where the algorithm uses input data to train a new model and serving where the algorithm accepts HTTP requests and uses the previously trained model to do an prediction.

## Build image

Execute the following command to build the image:

```sh
docker build -t mindsdb-sage .
```
Note that mindsdb-sage will be the name of the image.
